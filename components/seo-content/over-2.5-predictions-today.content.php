                    <h4><strong>What Is an Over 2.5 Goals Bet?</strong></h4> 
<p>An <strong>over 2.5 goals</strong> bet simply means that you’re predicting the total number of goals in a match will be three or more. It doesn’t matter which team scores or in which half the goals are made, as long as the game sees at least three goals. This makes over 2.5 goals bets appealing because they’re not tied to the match outcome—just to the combined goal tally.</p>
