                <li><strong>Double Chance Bets</strong>: In tricky matches like Chelsea vs. Arsenal, using double chance (e.g., Arsenal to win or draw) can reduce risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Over/Under Goals</strong>: For matches involving attacking powerhouses like Borussia Dortmund vs. RB Leipzig, betting on over 2.5 goals can be profitable.</li>
                <li><strong>Bet on Draws</strong>: High-profile games such as AC Milan vs. Napoli often end in draws due to the teams’ tactical caution.</li>
